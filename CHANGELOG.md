# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v3.0.0], 2022-05-17
The following is a major release of the `rt` library.
There is support for the REST API version 1 as well as version 2.
Please note that this release contains breaking changes and requires adaptations to existing code, even if you are
sticking to version 1 of the API.
These changes were necessary in order to properly support both API versions.

### Added
- RT REST2 support was added and is mostly on par with the REST1 support (differences are a result of the REST2 API implementation differences in RT).
REST2 is a modern API based on JSON exchanges and thus the complex parsing of responses and request construction are no longer needed.

### Changes
- Existing exception classes were renamed to adhere to the naming convention (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#exception-names).
  - In case you do catch specific `rt` exceptions, a simple search/replace will do, see the changelog page in the documentation for details.
- Importing the `rt` class changed in order to better accommodate the new `rest2` implementation.
  - Where one use to be able to import `rt` using:
    `from rt import Rt`
  
    you now have to use the following syntax:
  
    `from rt.rest1 import Rt`
- Importing the `rt` module does no longer import all exceptions but only the core `RtError` exception.
If you require other exceptions, please import them from `rt.exceptions`.
- Use pytest instead of nose.

## [v2.2.2], 2022-04-08
- Fix bug in the get_ticket would omit certain fields in case they were empty instead of returning an empty list as was the previous behavior (#70).
- Add tests for verifying correct return result for AdminCc, Cc and Requestor fields.

## [v2.2.1], 2021-11-26
- Fix bug in get_attachment_content which was a workaround for a bug in RT <=4.2 (trailing new-lines) but which was fixed in RT >=4.2. This made tests fail and return falsely stripped attachment content.

## [v2.2.0], 2021-11-15
- Search has a parameter fields that can be used to return only particular fields for tickets. In some cases I noticed it will improve the speed of the query completion if you only need specific fields (#65 by @kimmoal).

## [v2.1.1], 2021-03-23
- Fix support for custom field values containing newlines in API responses (#10, #11)
  (the previous change in v1.0.11 fixed API requests) (#64)

## [v2.1.0], 2021-02-25
- Add the possibility to provide cookies as dict to authenticate (#60)
- Add 'Referer' header for CSRF check when cookies are used for authentication (#60)
- Add IS and IS NOT operators to search (#57)

## [v2.0.1], 2020-08-07
- Fix UnicodeDecodeError in logging code for non-text attachments (#50, #51)
- Documentation: Add a search example (#49)
- edit_ticket: Handle possible empty responses: When a ticket is not modified, at least with RT 4.x, an empty
  response could be returned. Gracefully handle that as success. (#47, #48)

## [v2.0.0], 2020-02-11
- Drop Python2 support
- Adjust Travis tests for Python3-only, and add v3.8
- Add inline typing

- Fix "no-else-after-return" and "no-else-after-raise"
- Fix "startswitch" typos / bugs
- Removed deprecated "basic_auth" and "digest_auth" parameters. The same functionality is given by specifying the
  "http_auth" with an instance of either object. This allows for more flexibility with various other alternative
  authentication methods.

## [v1.0.13], 2020-02-06
- Add deprecation warning for in the next major release unsupported parameters (basic_auth, digest_auth).
  They are now replaced with http_auth.
